2. Install the required dependencies:
   - [Adafruit_CircuitPython_BME280](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_BME280) library. Follow the installation instructions on the linked page.
3. Configure the script with your API keys for pwsweather, Windy, and Weather Underground.

## Usage

1. Run the script using Python: `python paraguidews.py`
2. View live data on the following platforms:
   - [Paraguide Webcams](https://paraguide.in/webcams/)
   - [Weather Underground Dashboard](https://www.wunderground.com/dashboard/pws/IBAIJN1)
